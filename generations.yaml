    description: "The Scion FR-S was Toyota's North American market variant of the jointly developed sports car project with Subaru, known as the Toyota 86/GT86 in other markets and the Subaru BRZ for Subaru's version. Designed as a return to Toyota's sports car heritage, the FR-S (which stood for Front-engine, Rear-wheel drive, Sport) was built around the principle of an affordable, lightweight sports coupe focused on handling and driver engagement rather than outright power. Powered by Subaru's naturally aspirated 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine with Toyota's D-4S direct and port injection system, the FR-S produced 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, delivered to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The lightweight chassis (curb weight around 2,800 pounds) featured a low center of gravity thanks to the flat-four engine design, with a near-perfect weight distribution of 53/47 front to rear. The suspension utilized MacPherson struts up front and a double-wishbone setup in the rear, tuned for responsive handling and controlled oversteer. The minimalist interior focused on the driving experience with supportive sport seats, a small-diameter steering wheel, and simple controls. Technology was limited compared to many contemporaries, maintaining the car's focus on driving purity and keeping the price point accessible. Over its short lifespan, the FR-S received minimal changes beyond special edition models with unique colors and minor equipment variations. When Toyota discontinued the Scion brand after the 2016 model year, the FR-S was rebranded as the Toyota 86 for the North American market, continuing the model's legacy under the parent company's nameplate."
